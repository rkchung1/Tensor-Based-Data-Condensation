# Tensor-Based-Data-Condensation
This project explores data condensation for tabular datasets using tensor methods. Data condensation is the process of generating a smaller (often synthetic) dataset that maintains model performance. Our goal is to reduce data size while preserving essential information for training and downstream tasks.
