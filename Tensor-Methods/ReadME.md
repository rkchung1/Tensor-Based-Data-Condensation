# In this folder, we will describe the pipeline and the code for the tensor methods for dataset condensation

## 1. Downloading the dataset
We download the dataset [ could be done by manually downloading it, or in this case, we utilized a script to download FashionMNIST ]

## 2. Dataset Preparation
Depending on the data type, we must assess if we need to run a auto-encoder on the dataset first. In the case of CoverType, we must run the autoencoder to perform dimensionality matching, and to reduce noise.
